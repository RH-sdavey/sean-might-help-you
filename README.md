# Build Status
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5388013f-ceda-4ecc-95fe-187dee925433/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/swhy/deploys)

## Hello! 
This is the github repo for https://swhy.netlify.com/ (Sean Will Help You)
A free linux tutorial website run by Sean. 
I have lots of ideas for tutorials and learning paths for users, now all I need is time/help to build it.

- If you want to report a bug/feaure about the site, use the issues tab above
- You can also create a task in the projct page above
- If you can help me out with creating content I would appreciate that
- I will be putting contribution info in the wiki when I get a chance
- I wont be taking any money through advertisements for the site, but may consider patreon in the future for donations


## Configuration

The site is configured by me, Sean. I dont need any help with that, and won't accept any PR that try to update my current configuration. If you feel something could be improved, please open an issue and I will consider implementing that


## Content

### Posts

-Posts are authored using Markdown and include some optional YAML frontmatter data properties. Please copy and paste these data properties from another existing page and edit appropriately. ( TODO put here info how to do that ) 

Each post should have a separate folder for the .md file in addition to any images or other media related to that post.  Posts are stored in a subfolder in the ```/content/``` directory; the target subfolder is set by the _blogPostDir_ property in _SiteConfig.js_.
Currently ```sean-posts```

### Authors

Each post can reference the author of the post, if the author is not set the default author will be used; which is controlled by the _blogAuthorId_ property in _SiteConfig.js_.  All authors, including the default author (aka _blodAuthorId_) must have an author JSON file.  These JSON files MUST be stored in a folder names ```sean-authors```, for Gatsby to parse them correctly.
